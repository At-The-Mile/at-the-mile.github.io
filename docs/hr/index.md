# At The Mile Human Resources Utility Bot

This bot is primarily used for internal Human Resources functions. However, to liaise between the HR team and the general public, the DevOps team has elected to create certain outward facing functionality, such as staff application statuses and applicant profiles, to allow users an easy way of interacting seamlessly with our HR team.

## Bot Staff
**Tyler (@blizzy8953)** - Core Maintainer

## To Report Issues
Use the bot's integrated `/bug-report` function, open an HR ticket, or message @blizzy8953 for urgent needs.

## Trivia
- If you watch carefully, the bot tends to have a status saying "Playing with HR files". However, when in maintenance mode and being worked on by a maintainer, the status reads "Watching Tyler fix bugs"!
